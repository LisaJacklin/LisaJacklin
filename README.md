### About Me
I am currently a student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, working towards a batchelors degree in computer engineering with hopes to graduate in 2024. I hope to be able to use my interest in coding and understanding how computers work in general, to find internships, and eventually the title of a true computer engineer later in the future.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - C++ : began learning in Fall 2021 ( CS 201) and still learning! I'm fairly comfortable with the language.
  - x86/ Arm64  : began learning in Fall 2022 ( CS 301). I have a pretty good understanding of this, and how assembly can be used to review performance.
  - VHDL : began learning in Fall 2022 (EE 243) and was used in combination with Quartus Prime. Although I still have a lot to learn, I am very comfortable with the basic creation of circuit components, but there is still much for me to learn in Spring 2023 (EE 443).
  - MATLAB : began learning in Fall 2022 ( EE 354). I can perform basic calculations, plots, and frequency domain plots and calculations. I still struggle with this language but there is as always, much more to learn and many more examples to practice with.
  - MIPS-16 : began learning in Spring 2023 (EE 443) and is another form of assembly language that was used with VHDL to understand how to enhance the performance of a microprocessor.
  - Python : began learning in the Summer 2023 as a personal side hobby and project, and have continued to enhance my understanding and useage of python with ACEP.
  - HTML : Began learning in Spring 2023 as a side project.
