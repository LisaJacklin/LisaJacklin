## Lisa Jacklin
### About Me
I am currently a student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, working towards a batchelors degree in computer engineering with hopes to graduate in 2024. I hope to be able to use my interest in coding and understanding how computers work in general, to find interships, and eventually the title of a true computer engineer later in the future.

### Currently Learning...
  - C++ : began learning in Fall 2021 ( CS 201) and still learning! I'm fairly comfortable with the language.
  - x86/ Arm64 : began learning in Fall 2022 ( CS 301). I have a pretty good undestanding of this, and how assembly can be used to review performance.
  - VHDL : began learning in Fall 2022 (EE 243) and was used in combination with Quartus Prime. Although I still have a lot to learn, I am very comfortable with the basic creation of circuit components, but there is still much for me to learn in Spring 2023 (EE 443).
  - MATLAB : began learning in Fall 2022 ( EE 354). I can perform basic calculations, plots, and frequency domain plots and calculations. I still struggle with this language but there is as always, much more to learn and many more examples to practice with.

### Currently Working on...
- EE 444: 
- EE 443:
- CS 321:
- MATH 307:
